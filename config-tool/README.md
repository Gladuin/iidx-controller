# Building
I used python 3.10 to create this, so it definitely works with that version. YMMV with other versions.

0. (Optional) Create a python VENV and activate it. [See here how](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
1. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Build the executable by running `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole config-tool.py`
3. Done.
