# iidx-controller
Software that enables you to create your own Arduino based beatmania IIDX controller.

# Features
 - HID lighting support (that works with btools and ttools).
 - Customisable sensitivity over HID for use with lightning mode or your own custom program (more on this further down).
 - Different lighting modes (more info on this further down in the `Setup` section).

# Requirements
 - An Arduino Leonardo (technically compatible with any ATmega32U4 based board, but only tested with a Leonardo).
 - The [Bounce2](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/bounce2/) library.

# Setup
Buttons:
 - One terminal to GND and the other terminal to the corresponding pin.

LEDs:
 - Positive terminal to corresponding pin.
 - Negative terminal to GND.

Encoder:
 - The encoder's phase wires can be connected to any digital data pins.
 - Set `ENCODER_PPR` in `iidx-controller/config.h' to the PPR of your encoder.

Manufacturer name:
 - By setting `MF_NAME` in `iidx-controller/config.h`, you can change the manufacturer name of your controller.
 - You can change this to whatever you'd like, such as your name.
 
Spoof Konami official controller:
 - Set `KONAMI_SPOOF` to `1` to spoof the manufacturer (thus also ignoring `MF_NAME`) and product name of the beatmania IIDX controller premium model.
 - Useful for when you want to play beatmania Infinitas.
   
Increments per full turn:
 - The value here sets the number of increments required to reach a full 360Â° turn.
 - Set `INCREMENTS_PER_FULL_TURN` in `iidx-controller/config.h` to one of the values listed there.
 - The sensitivity setting interferes with this, it's recommended you leave it disabled.  

Sensitivity:
 - Disabled by default, enable by setting `NO_SENSITIVITY` to `0` in `iidx-controller/config.h`.
 - More info in the `HID Sensitivity` section.
 
LED mode switching:
 - Hold the last button in the button array, and then tap the first button in the button array to switch modes.
 - The LED mode rotation is as follows:
   1. HID / reactive auto (default setting, this switches to reactive mode if there are no LED HID messages in 3 seconds)
   2. Reactive only
   3. HID only
   4. HID _and_ reactive

Info:
 - Pinouts are available in `iidx-controller/config.h`, you can edit them there if necessary.
 - Leonardo pinout (what the numbers in the codes pinout arrays mean) at the bottom of this page.
 
# HID Sensitivity
In spice, select `Beatmania IIDX` and go to the `Lights` tab. Scroll down until you see `Turntable P1 Resistance` and click the `Bind` button.  
For `Device` select your Arduino, and for `Light Control` select `TT Sensitivity`.

You'll then be able to set the turntable sensitivity via the resistance menu on the subscreen in iidx >27 (with lightning mode enabled).

_NOTE: I haven't actually been able to test this, since I have a 60hz screen and can't boot into lightning mode. Please report any issues you encounter in the issues section._
